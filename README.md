In this build I recreate the fantastic Bleep Labs 'Bleep Drum' into a Eurorack format module. I'm working on building my own 'simple' 9v Eurorack which this synth will be a part of.
Check out my other recent builds to see the other modules already designed.

So what is the Bleep Drum Synth? Well it's an Arduino based drum machine that allows you to play drum tracks using 4 different samples and record them so you can layer them them up and create some great drum beats.
I have also added a Sync in which allows you to connect to other modules and play along with them.

Here's a rundown of the features:

– Four sounds, two with pitch control
– Sync in
– You can reverse the samples
– Record patterns just by playing them. The built in quantizer keeps hits where you want them.
– Click track
– Tap tempo
– Reverse mode
– Noise mode
– 9V battery powered
The main goal with building this module is to create my own 'simple to build' modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as easy as possble with each module built with the following aims:

I have also posted a video on my YouTube page - 

The main goal with building this module is to create my own 'simple to build' modular synth. I wanted to keep everything as easy as possble with each module built with the following aims:

Can be powered by 9V (and 12V)
Easy to build with minimum components
Use Arduino to keep it simple (plus it helps to keep the components down and everything in tune)
Can fit into any modular synth Eurorck (include the ability to power the module via normal module power sources)
Has to sound great!
Lastly, it should be portable and be powered from a 9V battery
